# Domain.Factory

**Domain.Factory** is a lightweight and flexible .NET library that implements the Factory pattern 
as described in Eric Evansâ€™ *Domain-Driven Design*. 
It provides a consistent and configurable way to create complex domain entities and aggregates 
by encapsulating construction logic **outside** the entities themselves â€” 
while keeping everything within the **domain layer**.
